# Advance-Two-Speed-Transmission-Modeling-Auto-Gear-Optimisation
This model helps determine the optimal gear ratios for battery energy consumption and motor efficiency, and analyzes motor operating points for both gears in a two-speed transmission. It uses linear search algorithms with advanced MATLAB scripting (e.g., for loops) to find the optimum gear ratio.
